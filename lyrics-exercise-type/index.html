            <p>It was a real sunny day, we were chilling in the land</p>
            <p>Of the Camperdown Park, nobody had a frown</p>
            <p>Reminiscing on the days when we used to have a blaze</p>
            <p>Everybody came around and we laxed out on the laze</p>
            <p>And I remember when we'd drink</p>
            <p>And we'd smoke, and we'd spar, and we'd laugh</p>
            <p>And the night would just go on and on</p>
            <p id="goodline">For the rest of my life, that memory will stay</p>
            <p id="goodline">Man, fuck, that was a good time</p>
            <p class="chorus">I don't feel afraid from you</p>
            <p class="chorus">I don't feel afraid from you</p>
            <p class="chorus">I don't feel afraid from you</p>
            <p class="chorus">I don't feel afraid from you</p>
            <p>'Cause I'm high, chewing on your taste</p>
            <p>Forever feels like such a waste</p>
            <p>So many places to be, people to meet</p>
            <p>In tropical heat</p>
            <p>Well, see, now this was the time when everything was perfect</p>
            <p>We can jump around to the sound of the music</p>
            <p>When you feel it, the bass coming through the tremolo</p>
            <p>Passages just seem to go real, real slow</p>
            <p>And this is what I want, and this is what you get</p>
            <p id="goodline">Come and share a toast for all our times we recollect</p>
            <p>From the start into these bends, we unwind our weary heads</p>
            <p>Being clever never sweats ya when forever has no end</p>
            <p>'Cause I'm high, chewing on your taste</p>
            <p>Forever feels like such a waste</p>
            <p>So many places to be, and people to meet</p>
            <p>In tropical heat</p>
            <p class="chorus">I don't feel afraid from you</p>
            <p class="chorus">I don't feel afraid from you</p>
            <p class="chorus">I don't feel afraid from you</p>
            <p class="chorus">I don't feel afraid from you</p>
            <p>You can not contemplate on all of what we've mastered</p>
            <p>Compelled by different women as a strong current passes</p>
            <p>All the little organisms swirling through the white</p>
            <p>All my rested hollow bones ready to pick a fight</p>
            <p>All my pity get witty and driven through the sky</p>
            <p>All the faces that change the same smile far and wide</p>
            <p>I was coming down the other day, next thing I was years away</p>
            <p id="goodline">I only wish that we could stay, my brother</p>
